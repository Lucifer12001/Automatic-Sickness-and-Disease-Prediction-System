# Automatic-Sickness-and-Disease-Prediction-System
•	Developed a software system that utilizes machine learning and predictive analytics to predict a patient's COVID-19 status based on their symptoms .

•	The system should be designed to work with a variety of electronic medical records (EMR) systems and be able to integrate with different data sources to obtain necessary patient information.

•	The system should have a user-friendly interface that allows healthcare providers to input patient data, view predictions, and adjust the model parameters as needed.

•	The system should be able to make predictions for COVID-19.

•	The predictions should be based on the latest medical research and best practices, and the system should be updated regularly to reflect new findings and changes in medical guidelines.

•	The system should be scalable and able to handle large volumes of data, so it can be used by hospitals and clinics of all sizes.

•	The system should be secure and compliant with relevant regulations, such as HIPAA, to protect patient privacy.

•	The system should be customizable to meet the needs of different healthcare providers and patient populations.

•	The system should be reliable and accurate, with a high level of precision and recall for predicting patient outcomes.

•	The system should be designed to improve patient outcomes and reduce healthcare costs by enabling early detection and intervention for health problems.
